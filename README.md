# TagsToTable a.k.a. TTT

- TTT is the last step in the NICU monitoring data engineering and algorithm calculation [Software Chain](https://github.com/UVA-CAMA/NICUHDF5Viewer/wiki) created by scientists and technicians in Center for Advanced Medical Analytics (CAMA), school of Medicine, UVA. 
- To get clinically meaningful information from NICU bedside monitoring data, such as unfavorable events during infants' respiratory trajectory, or statistical moments of Vital signs or chest-impedience signals, users should go through this software chain "UFC - BAP/HDF5Viwer - MergeTags - TTT". 
- You can download table format daily, hourly, or every UTC second event result or statistic values of bedside monitoring data of any study cohort of your interest in a csv file, after putting resultmerge.mat and logmerged.mat of this cohort that have been generated by BAP in a single folder / directory on your computer, and run TTT.
